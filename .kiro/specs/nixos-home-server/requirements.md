# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a comprehensive NixOS configuration for a development-focused home server that provides both server functionality and a development environment. The system will serve as a home server for web services, file sharing, and development work, with reliable remote access from macOS devices and comprehensive development tooling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a complete development environment with modern tooling, so that I can develop applications in multiple programming languages effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN development tools are installed THEN the system SHALL support TypeScript, Java, C++, Rust, and Python development
2. WHEN shell environment is configured THEN the system SHALL provide zsh with best practice plugins and configurations
3. WHEN version control is needed THEN the system SHALL include Git with configuration copied from the Mac deployment machine
4. WHEN Git credentials are needed THEN the system SHALL copy Git credentials and SSH keys from the Mac to enable seamless repository access
5. WHEN container development is required THEN the system SHALL support both Docker and Podman
6. WHEN package management is needed THEN the system SHALL use the latest stable NixOS version with flakes enabled

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Mac user, I want reliable remote access to my home server, so that I can work on development projects from my Mac with a functional GUI environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN remote GUI access is needed THEN the system SHALL provide a lightweight desktop environment optimized for remote access from macOS
2. WHEN SSH access is configured THEN the system SHALL allow passwordless SSH login from the local network using the same username
3. WHEN remote desktop is used THEN the system SHALL provide stable screen sharing that works reliably with macOS clients
4. WHEN the system boots THEN remote access services SHALL start automatically and be accessible

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a home server administrator, I want secure network services with proper firewall configuration, so that my server is protected while allowing necessary access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the firewall is configured THEN the system SHALL enable the firewall and only allow ports for active services
2. WHEN SSH is configured THEN the system SHALL allow SSH access from the local network
3. WHEN web services are running THEN the system SHALL allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic
4. WHEN file sharing is active THEN the system SHALL allow Samba/CIFS ports for local network access
5. WHEN PostgreSQL is running THEN the system SHALL restrict database access to localhost only

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want a complete web development stack, so that I can develop and test web applications locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN web services are configured THEN the system SHALL provide Nginx with SSL/TLS support
2. WHEN database services are needed THEN the system SHALL provide PostgreSQL with local trust authentication
3. WHEN SSL certificates are required THEN the system SHALL support automatic certificate management with ACME and Certbot
4. WHEN certificate renewal is needed THEN the system SHALL automatically renew SSL certificates before expiration
5. WHEN web content is served THEN the system SHALL serve content from a designated web root directory

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a mobile device user, I want to access shared files from my iPhone, so that I can easily transfer files between devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN file sharing is configured THEN the system SHALL provide Samba shares accessible from iOS devices
2. WHEN network discovery is needed THEN the system SHALL support SMB network discovery protocols
3. WHEN file permissions are set THEN the system SHALL allow read/write access to designated shared directories
4. WHEN mobile access occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain stable connections for file transfers

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive backup and monitoring capabilities, so that I can maintain system health and protect important data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backups are configured THEN the system SHALL support automated backups to a Mac folder or iCloud
2. WHEN system monitoring is active THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive logging and monitoring tools
3. WHEN system health is checked THEN the system SHALL provide easy-to-use monitoring interfaces and commands
4. WHEN system issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logs for troubleshooting

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a Mac user, I want automated deployment scripts, so that I can easily push configuration changes from my Mac to the NixOS server.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment is needed THEN the system SHALL provide a script to push configuration from Mac to the NixOS machine
2. WHEN SSH access is configured THEN the system SHALL support passwordless SSH from Mac to the NixOS server (hostname: nixos)
3. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL allow remote rebuilding of the NixOS system from the Mac
4. WHEN deployment fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and rollback capabilities

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a new user, I want clear documentation and setup instructions, so that I can deploy and configure the system easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation is provided THEN the system SHALL include a comprehensive README with step-by-step setup instructions
2. WHEN the configuration is deployed THEN the system SHALL support deployment from a GitHub repository
3. WHEN initial setup is performed THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for first-time configuration
4. WHEN troubleshooting is needed THEN the system SHALL include common problem resolution steps

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a modular and maintainable configuration structure, so that I can easily manage and extend the server configuration over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the configuration is organized THEN the system SHALL use a modular structure with separate files for different services
2. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL support easy rollbacks to previous configurations
3. WHEN new services are added THEN the configuration SHALL follow consistent patterns and naming conventions
4. WHEN the system is updated THEN the configuration SHALL use the latest stable NixOS version with modern best practices
